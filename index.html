<h2 class="western">I'm Ayushman! Welcome to my homepage.</h2>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">I’m an ardent politics buff, disgruntled movie fanatic, frustrated lover of literature, die-hard quizzer, Pink Floyd fan, tech geek and a connoisseur of progressive rock music.</p> 

<p class="text-justify">At present, I am working as an Assistant Professor of English at The Assam Royal Global University, Guwahati. I am also pursuing a PhD in English from University of Gauhati, specializing in Russian Émigré Literature. Prior to this, I did my Master of Arts in English from Tezpur University.</p>

<p class="text-justify">This webpage is my personal space. More like a journal- a canvas where I can freely paint my thoughts and share my ideas. Writing helps me allign my thoughts and declutter my mind. Now-a-days, I don't get much free time to write. Research, academic assignments and work squueze in the last drops of jucice out of me every single day. When I get a day or two off, I like to enjoy cathing up with friends or watching a movie. You see, writing takes the back seat. But on rare occassions, I take my journal out and attempt to pen down my thoughts. My blog is the result of those not-so-failed attempts, the ones I consider fit for publishing online. I hope you enjoy reading it. </p> 

<p class="text-justify">I'm quite active on Twitter. If you wish you may follow me there. I have linked all my social media profiles below. Feel free to contact.</p>
