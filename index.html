<h2 class="western">I'm Ayushman! Welcome to my homepage.</h2>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">I’m an ardent politics buff, disgruntled movie fanatic, frustrated lover of literature, die-hard quizzer, Pink Floyd fan, tech geek and a connoisseur of progressive rock music.</p> 

<p class="text-justify">At present, I’m reading for a PhD in Russian Literature at Gauhati University. My areas of specialisation are Displacement Narratives, Emigre Literature, and Diaspora. Since August 2017, I have been working as a Guest Faculty in the Deptt. of English B. Borooah College, Guwahati. Prior to this, I did my Master of Arts in English from Tezpur University.</p>

<p class="text-justify">This webpage is my personal space. More like a journal- a canvas where I can freely paint my thoughts and share my ideas. Writing helps me declutter my mind and allign my thoughts. I don't get time to write much now-a-days. Research, academic assignments and work squueze in the last drops out of my jucice every single day. When I get a day or two off, I like to enjoy cathing uo with friends or watching a movie or a series. Writing takes the back seat. But on some rare occassions, I take my journal out and make attempt to pen down my thoughts. My blog is the result of those not-so-failed attempts, the ones that made the cut and survived. I hope you enjoy reading it.</p>
