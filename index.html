<h5 class="western"> <em>briefly about me:</em> </h5>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">Iâ€™m an ardent movie buff, frustrated lover of literature, die hard quizzer, tech geek, and a connoisseur of prog-rock music. I enjoy talking long walks, watching reruns of The Office, and relaxing to Pink Floyd. I am the most happy when I am in a quiz! </p> 

<h5 class="western"> <em>at present:</em></h5>

<p class="text-justify"> I am working as an Assistant Professor of English at The Assam Royal Global University, Guwahati. I am also reading for a PhD in post-immigration and diasporic Russian literature at Gauhati University. The title of my thesis is - <em>Hybrid Cultures, Plural Identities: (De)Constructing the Hyphen in Russian-Jewish Diasporic Literature</em><em class="special">.</em> Prior to this, I did my Master of Arts in English from Tezpur University.

A few weeks ago, I was offered The Sahapedia-UNESCO Fellowship for the year 2020. You can read more about the fellowship <a href="https://www.sahapedia.org/sahapedia-unesco-fellowship-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
