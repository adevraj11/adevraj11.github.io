<h4 class="western"> <em>briefly about me:</em> </h4>

<p class="text-justify">Iâ€™m an ardent movie buff, frustrated lover of literature, die hard quizzer, tech geek, and a connoisseur of prog-rock music. I enjoy talking long walks, watching reruns of The Office, and relaxing to Pink Floyd. I am the most happy when I am in a quiz! Also, have you seen the new Batman movie trailer?! HYPED!</p> 

<h4 class="western"> <em>at present:</em></h4>

<p class="text-justify"> I am working as an Assistant Professor of English at The Assam Royal Global University, Guwahati. I am also reading for a PhD in post-immigration and diasporic Russian literature at Gauhati University. The title of my thesis is - <em>Hybrid Cultures, Plural Identities: (De)Constructing the Hyphen in Russian-Jewish Diasporic Literature</em><em class="special">.</em> Prior to this, I did my Master of Arts in English from Tezpur University.</p>
