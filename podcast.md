<h5> PocketCasts is my favourite podcast app.</h5> 
<p> Although I use Spotify, I like to keep my podcast app different from my music app. I purchased this app from the Google Playstore almost a year ago and since then I've have listened to various podcasts for 46 days and 7 hours (their stats, not mine!). I have tried to link all the podcasts that I am currently listening to below! Enjoy listening! </p>

<h4> <a href="https://www.earwolf.com/show/conan-obrien/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend </a> </h4>
 - After 25 years at the Late Night desk, Conan realized that the only people at his holiday party are the men and women who work for him. Over the years and despite thousands of interviews, Conan has never made a real and lasting friendship with any of his celebrity guests. So, he started a podcast to do just that. Deeper, unboundedly playful, and free from FCC regulations, Conan Oâ€™Brien Needs a Friend is a weekly opportunity for Conan to hang out with the people he enjoys most and perhaps find some real friendship along the way.
