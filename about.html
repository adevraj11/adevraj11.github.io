<h2 class="western">Hello! I am Ayushman.</h2>

<p>I’m an ardent politics buff, disgruntled movie fanatic, frustrated lover of literature, die-hard quizzer, and the occasional teacher. Presently, I’m a PhD Research Fellow at Gauhati University. My areas of specialisation are Displacement Narratives, Exile Literature, and Diaspora. I am also working as a Guest Faculty in B. Borooah College, Guwahati.</p>
